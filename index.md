# Portfolio


## Personal Projects

This is my personal portfolio where I update some of the projects that I am currently envolved or projects that are completed. The main areas will most likely always be Software Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Science, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning.

The projects are strictly non-commercial and are mainly developed for personal growth and for learning new technologies in the areas aforementioned.
